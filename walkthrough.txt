### Debian 12 (Bookworm) for the Surface RT | Walkthrough
### In dept shown in video tutorial, text walkthrough will be added here soon.

After initially booting from the usb, follow some preliminary steps:
  mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot/firmware
  resize filesystem using fdisk & resize2fs;
  update fstab values to mount:
    /dev/mmcblk1p2  as   /
    /dev/mmcblk1p1  as   /boot/firmware 
  update hostname && hosts;
  create user 'pi'; get sudo rights for pi; (must name it pi for the scripts to work!)

then:
  make opt dir executable using chmod -R +x /boot/firmware/opt
  move to /opt/custom-scripts/ 

    run the scripts serialwise (and follow any on-screen instructions):
      load-drivers;
      wifi-setup;
      install-packages;
      install-vulkan;
      clone-disk;

Voila! Your device is ready for daily use.
